As a Durham College Scholar, I have worked on following projects:


**Covid-19 Vaccination rate Dashboard**

This dashboard helps the government or other health institutions to visualise a single view of Vaccination rate in various nations and how many more vaccines are needed to create a healthy nation.The tools used in this reporting mechanics are as follows:

#Microsoft Excel

#Tableau


**Executive Summary of Job Revenue in Canada**

 Input- MS Excel
 
 Visualisations- Tableau

**DESCRIPTION OF THE CODING USED IN PYTHON:
•	Firstly, I have imported three libraries pandas, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot in the python
•	For gaining more knowledge about the dataset, I have gone through the youtube_dataset.csv file thrice so that I can easily understand about the variables and their data types. 
•	Then, I imported that dataset into python by making sure that it would be imported into python properly as further coding is not possible without importing it properly into python. So, it is the most important step.
1.	Then I create a function inside which I would call the csv file. 
2.	I sorted the data and then extraced the first 1000 rows.
3.	I included and made a bar diagram while printing.
4.	I then called the csv file into the function.
5.	The final step is to print the new csv file
